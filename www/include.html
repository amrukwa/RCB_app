<div align="justify">Treatment Efficacy Score (TES) can capture the relative efficacy of one treatment (e.g. experimental treatment) over the other (e.g. standard of care) by analyzing the distribution of&nbsp;continuous Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score. We developed three independent methods to&nbsp;calculate TES, that could be tested here.</div>
