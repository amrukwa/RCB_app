Treatment Efficacy Score (TES) can capture the relative efficacy of one treatment (e.g. experimental treatment) over the other (e.g. standard of care) by analyzing the distribution of continuous Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score. <wbr>We developed three independent methods to calculate TES, that could be tested here.
